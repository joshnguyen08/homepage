        </p>
        <p class="indent-text">This project is a collection of Python scripts that I have written for various purposes.
            These include a python password checker, rock paper scissor game, and a 2D ball bouncing game.

    <p class="indent-text">
        Developed a Pong game using Pygame library, showcasing skills in Python programming, game development, and event handling. Designed a simple game interface with custom graphics, and integrated a game-over screen with elapsed time display. Demonstrated understanding of collision detection and physics concepts to simulate realistic ball and paddle interactions. Implemented a dynamic game loop that adapts to user input and maintain consistent gameplay at 60 FPS.

    </p>
    <p class="indent-text">
        Developed a Python-based network traffic monitoring script to capture and analyze packet traffic on a network. Utilized Pyshark, Socket, and Whois libraries to extract relevant information about the packet such as source and destination IP, transport protocol, and packet length. Demonstrated understanding of network protocols and ability to identify suspicious packets based on certain criteria, such as repeated packets or abnormal packet size. Displayed captured packet information in a user-friendly format to facilitate analysis and understanding of network traffic.

    <p class="indent-text">
        Developed a simple Java-based network monitoring application to manage access to websites and files. Utilized data structures, such as HashSet, to store and validate authorized websites. Implemented file I/O operations to read and update the /etc/hosts file for blocking unauthorized website access. Demonstrated understanding of network security concepts and protective measures.
